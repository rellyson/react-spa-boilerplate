# React SPA Boilerplate

## About

This is a boilerplate to create a react single page application. It uses Vite as build tool, react router for routing and axios as http client.

## Why to use vite in my react application?

Using Vite give us the availability of native ES modules in the browser, and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.
